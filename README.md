# Page-Rank

Parallel implementation of PageRank algorithm.

# Description :

PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages.

This is simple implementation of PageRank algorithm using CSR(Compressed Sparse Row) format of matrix. Also we have used Power Iteration method to solve corresponding equations.
